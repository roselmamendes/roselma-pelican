## Publishing

1. Add a .md file with the proper attributes (check existent .md files to get examples)
2. Run `sh cli/blog.sh build-layout`. Locally it will create the server/template folder. It is necessary to copy the content from static to server/static.

To see locally run `sh cli/blog.sh start-server`.
